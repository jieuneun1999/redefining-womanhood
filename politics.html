        <h1 class="gradient-text">POLITICS</h1>
        <p>
          Historically in the Philippine context, the political arena has been a
          male dominated space but the landscape is shifting as more women take
          on leadership roles globally. While progress is steady, it is often
          met with systemic hurdles ranging from cultural biases to a lack of
          access to campaign funding. Despite these challenges, female
          representation is no longer just about "having a seat at the table" it
          is about fundamentally changing the conversation. In the Philippines,
          the political journey of women is a narrative of reclaimed power
          moving from pre-colonial equality to a century-long struggle for the
          vote, and eventually to the highest office in the land. Filipino women
          evolved from high-status pre-colonial leaders and Babaylans to legal
          minors under three centuries of restrictive Spanish patriarchal rule.
          Despite being relegated to the domestic sphere, they played critical
          roles in the Philippine Revolution by using their homes for espionage
          and logistics. This spirit of resistance eventually shifted toward
          organized activism in the early 1900s through groups like the
          Asociacion Femenista Filipina and Asociacion Femenista Ilongga. Their
          decades of lobbying culminated in the 1937 plebiscite, where women
          shattered a constitutional requirement by gathering over 447,000 "Yes"
          votes, officially securing their right to vote and making the
          Philippines a pioneer for women's suffrage in Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the approval of Act No. 4112 by President Manuel L. Quezon,
          Filipino women gained the right to vote and hold office, leading to a
          growing presence in national leadership. The Philippines notably
          produced Asia’s first female president, Corazon C. Aquino and followed
          by Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, alongside influential legislators such as
          Miriam Defensor-Santiago, Pia Cayetano, and Loren Legarda.
          Additionally, the Party-list System Act has amplified women's
          advocacy, with groups like Gabriela consistently securing
          congressional seats to address gender-specific needs. From 1998 to
          2016, the percentage of women elected into public office ranged from
          16.1 percent to 21.44 percent, reaching its peak in the 2016
          elections. In the 2019 National and Local Elections, only 20.16
          percent (8,782) of the candidates were female. The Magna Carta of
          Women (Republic Act 9710) provides under Section 11 the undertaking of
          temporary special measures to accelerate the participation and
          equitable representation of women in all spheres of society
          particularly in the decision-making and policy-making processes in
          government and private entities to fully realize their role as agents
          and beneficiaries of development. It mandates the adoption of
          temporary special measures for the incremental increase of women in
          third level positions in the civil service until a fifty-fifty (50-50)
          gender balance is achieved and at least 40% women in developmental
          councils. Several studies presented that women in key positions in
          government have shown that they are as capable and effective as their
          male counterparts in assuming leadership and decision-making roles.
          Promoting women’s representation in elected bodies allows them to
          contribute to development and nation-building as well as ensure that
          governance leads to equal access to resources and to development
          results and outcomes for both women and men. It is also indicated that
          women as legislators represent not only for women but for the
          improvement of policy to be responsive especially to the marginalized
          and less privileged individual. Thus, elected women in office
          alleviate the quality of life and reflect the priorities for all the
          families, women, and ethnic and racial minorities (Volden , Wiseman, &
          Wittmer, 2010). Rosenthal (2001) explained that women function much
          better than men in terms of leadership, conflict resolution styles,
          participation, and collaboration and women are known to be less
          hierarchical in work. Thus, women always proved to stay calm even in a
          very difficult situation and exceptionally listen attentively to the
          call of peace making. In addition to that, the Institute for Inclusive
          Security (2009) indicates women being part of peace processes can
          probably increase the level of peace stability, lessen corruption, and
          exemplify health care and education in the community.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is why the necessity in understanding women is utmost significant
          especially in forecasting the trend in the participation of women in
          politics since women play an important role in nation building. Hence,
          the participation of women in politics can’t be taken for granted
          since year by year the augmentation is conspicuous. Using the Bass
          Diffusion model as the representation of diffusive adoption, the study
          then predicts the saturation of women participation in politics with
          respect to time and provides a basis in program implementation related
          to gender equality and/or women empowerment.
