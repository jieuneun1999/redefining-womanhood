            src="image/classroom.jpg"

          <p>
            Education in the Philippines has undergone major changes from the
            pre-colonial period to the present. Before colonization, learning
            was informal and taught by parents. Girls were trained in sewing and
            housekeeping only, while boys learned hunting, carpentry, and other
            physical work outside. Despite these role differences, men and women
            were generally treated equally, and women could express influence
            and even take leadership roles. However, this equality declined
            during the Spanish colonization. During the Spanish period,
            education became religion-centered and was limited mostly to the
            elite. Women were taught to be submissive wives, and discrimination
            based on gender and social status became more evident. This created
            stereotypes that placed women below men. A major turning point came
            during the American period when public education was introduced,
            giving women access to higher education. In the 21st century, laws
            such as the Philippine Constitution and the Magna Carta of Women of
            (2009) promote gender equality and prevent discrimination. Recent
            data from the Philippine Statistics Authority year (2024–2025) even
            show that Filipina women have higher literacy rates than men, with a
            rate of 74.1% for women and 67.6% for men, proving that with proper
            support and equal opportunities, women can achieve great success in
            education and professional fields. Supporting these local actions,
            Philippine law provides a strong foundation for women’s education
            and training. The Magna Carta of Women (Republic Act No. 9710)
            ensures that women have equal access to scholarships and training.
            Furthermore, Quezon City’s own Gender and Development (GAD) Code
            reinforces these rights by requiring the city to provide skills
            training and leadership programs for women in every barangay.

          <p>
            Since the turn of the century, the educational profile of the
            Filipina has shifted to reverse common developing-world trends, with
            women now leading in several key metrics. While 1980 data showed
            overall male literacy slightly higher at 84% versus 83% for females,
            younger generations have flipped this gap. Urban females boast a
            97.1% literacy rate compared to 96.8% for males, and rural females
            lead 89.9% to 88%. This female academic advantage is further
            evidenced by lower dropout rates in 1982–83, where only 2.3% of
            girls left elementary school and 6% left high school, compared to
            3.3% and 9% for boys, respectively. Consequently, women dominated
            higher education in the late 1970s, making up 54% of tertiary
            students, 64% of graduate students, and 65% of those in postgraduate
            programs. However, gender concentration persists in specific fields.
            Women comprised the vast majority in food and nutrition (92%) and
            medical sciences (87%), but remained underrepresented in engineering
            (14%), law (9%), and maritime education (0.9%). To support this
            continuously developing trajectory in the education sector, the
            TESDA Women’s Center, the QC Data Science Scholarship, and the DOST
            Undergraduate Scholarships collectively represent a powerful shift
            toward breaking gender barriers in high-growth, male-dominated
            industries.

        <!-- Section 3 -->
        <div class="section">
          <img src="image/tesda.jpg" alt="Education Image 3" loading="lazy" />
          <p>
            By offering specialized technical-vocational training, the TESDA
            Women’s Center empowers women to master complex skills in fields
            like automotive technology and electronics, transforming what were
            once considered "non-traditional" roles into accessible career
            paths. Complementing this, the QC Data Science Scholarship serves as
            a localized catalyst for the next generation of female leaders by
            providing students with the advanced analytical tools needed for
            high-tech careers. Furthermore, the DOST Undergraduate Scholarships
            provide critical national support for women pursuing degrees in
            Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), ensuring
            that financial barriers do not hinder their academic excellence.
            Together, these programs ensure that Filipino women are not just
            participants in the modern economy but are technically proficient
            experts and innovators capable of thriving in the digital and
            industrial dimension. Historically, the four periods of women’s
            education highlight a significant shift toward providing equal
            opportunities and celebrating diversity in learning. Women
            significantly transformed education by expanding access for girls,
            promoting gender-inclusive policies, and establishing institutions
            that supported academic excellence and leadership. They influenced
            curriculum reforms by integrating values of education, ethics, and
            social responsibility into learning systems, while also
            strengthening research standards and professional training in higher
            education and health education. Globally, women also shaped
            learner-centered approaches that emphasize child development,
            independence, and experiential learning. These contributions
            collectively improved both the structure and philosophy of modern
            education systems (UNESCO, 1995; UNESCO, 2015; Montessori, 1912). By
            moving through these stages, society has begun to recognize the true
            value and capabilities of women, effectively breaking down the
            restrictive stereotypes of the past. This progress ensures that
            education serves as a tool for positive change, allowing women to
            reach their full potential in an equal and inclusive environment.
